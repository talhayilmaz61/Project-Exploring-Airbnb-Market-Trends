# Project-Exploring-Airbnb-Market-Trends
This project focuses on analyzing New York City's Airbnb market by combining data from multiple sources. It provides insights into how Airbnb caters to the lodging needs of travelers in one of the worldâ€™s most-visited cities.

Tasks:
As a consultant working for a real estate start-up, you have collected Airbnb listing data from various sources to investigate the short-term rental market in New York. You'll analyze this data to provide insights on private rooms to the real estate company.

There are three files in the data folder: airbnb_price.csv, airbnb_room_type.xlsx, airbnb_last_review.tsv.

What are the dates of the earliest and most recent reviews? Store these values as two separate variables with your preferred names.
How many of the listings are private rooms? Save this into any variable.
What is the average listing price? Round to the nearest two decimal places and save into a variable.
Combine the new variables into one DataFrame called review_dates with four columns in the following order: first_reviewed, last_reviewed, nb_private_rooms, and avg_price. The DataFrame should only contain one row of values.

Welcome to New York City, one of the most-visited cities in the world. There are many Airbnb listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months. In this project, we will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.xlsx`.
